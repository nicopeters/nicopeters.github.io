				<h1>Hi there!</h1>

                <p>You are invited to "Die wilde 13" party to celebrate the last 13 years of Signavio - hosted by Gero, Gerrit, Nico, Torben and Willi.<br>
                We will spend a crazy day together with lots of activities, shows, music acts, drinks and food. And for you, everything is for free. If you feel you would like to give something back for the luck to be part of this wonderful event, we want to take the opportunity to point you to an initiative we are super excited about - "<a href="https://www.berlin2030.org/en-US">Berlin 2030 Klimaneutral</a>".
                </p>
                <p>
					</p><h3>What is Berlin 2030?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is not just another petition, but a legally binding referendum ("Volksbegehren") to transform Berlin to a carbon neutral city already in 2030 as the first capital in Europe. We would love to see Berlin as a lighthouse project in the transformation to a net-zero emission world. To make this happen at least 180.000 signatures from Berlin citizens have to be collected on paper(!) between July and November 2022. 
                </p>
                <p>
					</p><h3>How can I support the initiative?</h3>
                <p>
                    You may imagine the effort it takes to organize all the people to collect so many signatures. If you like, you could do three things to support the initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Check out <a href="https://www.berlin2030.org/en-US">Berlin 2030</a> to learn more about the initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Register yourself to become part of the community and help collecting the signatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. The initiative is supported and run by several non-profit organisations. One of them is Imagine Zero e.V. that develops the digital platform to organize, track and communicate the signature collection. If you like, you can support them with a donation via the following Paypal donation button.
